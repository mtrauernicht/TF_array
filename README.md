# integrated_TF-reporter_array

**Introduction:**\
Besides exploring TF activity episomally, I want to probe TF activities in an integrated setting, by integrating TF reporters in concatenated tandem arrays. 

**Structure:**\
This repository contains:
- Code TF reporter design -> which can be used to assemble TF reporters using bridge ligation or Golden Gate assembly
- Results of TIDE data generated with TF arrays
